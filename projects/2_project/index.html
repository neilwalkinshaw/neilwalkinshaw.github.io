  </header>

  <article class="post-content (E)FSM Inference clearfix">
    <p>State-based models of software behaviour can be very useful. There are many testing and verification approaches that can take advantage of such models. Unfortunately, they require a lot of knowledge and skill to develop by hand, and are rarely (if ever) included in real software development projects.</p>

<p>This project has been ongoing since 2006, and aims to develop techniques that are capable of reverse-engineering state machines from sequences of observed events. This is achieved by adapting and enhancing standard state machine inference (or regular grammar inference) Machine Learning techniques.</p>

<p>In recent years this has involved the development of state machines that have guards (Extended Finite State Machines), and even limited state transition computations, with the help of Genetic Programming.</p>

<p>This work has, over the past decade, involved collaborations with Kirill Bogdanov, John Derrick, Shaukat Ali, Sarah Salahuddin, Mike Holcombe, Ken Johnson, Ramsay Taylor and Mat Hall at the University of Sheffield, Tom Gransden at Leicester, as well as Pierre Dupont, Bernard Lambeau, and Christophe Damas at the University Catholique de Louvain.</p>
