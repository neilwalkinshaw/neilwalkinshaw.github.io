My research and teaching focus on software quality assurance. My research has a particular emphasis on “black-box” components - software units that lack documentation and cannot be scrutinised internally. I specialise in applying Machine Learning and other data analysis algorithms to the specific activities of testing, reverse-engineering, and safety-case assessment.

I studied my Ph.D. (2002-2005) at the [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/science/computerinformationsciences/){:target="\_blank"} on the use of static analysis to support software inspections. I subsequently spent five years (2005-2010) as a postdoc at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/indexdcs){:target="\_blank"}, working on state machine inference and software testing (an area in which I am still active). This was followed by 8 years as a Lecturer then Senior Lecturer / Associate Professor at the [Department of Informatics](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/informatics){:target="\_blank"} at the University of Leicester. I took up my current position as a Senior Lecturer at the University of Sheffield in 2018.

Within my department I am the Director of Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity. Most of my involvement over the past decade has revolved around initiatives to encourage more women to join (and stay in) our discipline. Most of this takes place through the development and management of [Athena SWAN](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/equality-charters/athena-swan-charter){:target="\_blank"} action plans. We are currently however also actively working towards action plans for [Race Equality](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/equality-charters/race-equality-charter){:target="\_blank"}, along with initiatives to better support our neurodiverse students and staff. I am always eager to discuss ideas or potential joint initiatives in this area.
