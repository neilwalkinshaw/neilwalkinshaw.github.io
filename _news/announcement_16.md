The EPSRC have funded our 3.5 year project CITCOM: Causal Inference for Testing Computational Models. Really excited to collaborate with Rob Hierons within the department, as well David Wagg in Mechanical engineering and Nicholas Latimer in the School for Health and Related Research. Also lots of exciting collaborations nationally and internationally. More details can be [found here](https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/citcom/home){:target="\_blank"}.
