Delighted that our paper "Bounding Random Test Set Size with Computational Learning Theory", written with Michael Foster, Jos√© Rojas and Rob Hierons, has been accepted to FSE 2024! In this paper we show how you can place a bound on the number of random tests that it will take to reach test saturation. A draft paper is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17019).
