Delighted that both of my Ph.D. students have had their excellent work accepted for publication this week. 

Andy Clark has had his paper "Metamorphic Testing with Causal Graphs" accepted to ICST (work with Michael Foster, myself and Rob Hierons). 

Richard Somers has had his paper "Digital-twin-based testing for cyber-physical systems: A systematic
literature review" accepted to Information and Software Technology (work with James Douthwaite, David Wagg, myself and Rob Hierons). 

Preprints on their way!
