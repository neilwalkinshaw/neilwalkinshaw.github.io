I and my colleague [James Law](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/people/academic/james-law) are currently advertising a fully funded Ph.D. opportunity to link testing with Machine Learning. This will be closely aligned with the University of Sheffield [Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC)](), providing a strong industrial foundation for the research. 

The details on the project and how to apply can be [found here](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/when-can-i-stop-testing-using-machine-learning-theory-to-bound-the-size-of-test-sets/?p163599). Please contact me with any questions!

Deadline is 24th of January, 2024.
